[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scoverage/gradle-scoverage.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scoverage/gradle-scoverage)

gradle-scoverage
================
A plugin to enable the use of Scoverage in a gradle Scala project.

Getting started
---------------
http://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.scoverage

This creates an additional task `testScoverage` which will run tests against instrumented code.

A further task `reportScoverage` produces XML and HTML reports for analysing test code coverage.

You can configure the version of Scoverage that will be used. This plugin should be compatible with all 1+ versions.

```groovy
scoverage {
    scoverageVersion = "1.3.1"
    scoverageScalaVersion = "2.12" // will be overridden by the 'scala-library' version (if configured)
}
```

Then launch command :
`gradle reportScoverage` or `gradle checkScoverage`

Available tasks
---------------

* testScoverage - Executes all tests and creates Scoverage XML report with information about code coverage
* reportScoverage - Generates reports (see below).
* aggregateScoverage - Aggregates reports from multiple sub-projects (see below).
* checkScoverage - See below.
* compileScoverageScala - Instruments code without running tests.

ReportScoverage
---------------

You can configure output generated by `gradle reportScoverage` using flags:

| Flag name               | Default value | Description                                     |
| ------------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| coverageOutputCobertura | true          | Enables/disables cobertura.xml file generation. |
| coverageOutputXML       | true          | Enables/disables scoverage XML output.          |
| coverageOutputHTML      | true          | Enables/disables scoverage HTML output.         |
| coverageDebug           | false         | Enables/disables scoverage debug output.        |

Aggregating Reports
-------------------

There is now experimental support for aggregating coverage statistics across sub-projects.

When applied on a project with sub-projects, the plugin will create the aggregation task `aggregateScoverage`. 

This will produce a report into `build/scoverage-aggregate` directory.

Aggregation uses same flags as reporting for enabling/disabling different output types.

For checking coverage of the aggregated result, configure the checkScoverage task:

```groovy
checkScoverage {
     reportDir = file("$buildDir/scoverage-aggregate")
}
```

CheckScoverage
--------------

By default, when you launch `gradle checkScoverage` build fail if only 75% of statements in project is covered by tests.

To configure it as you want, add this configuration :
```
checkScoverage {
    minimumRate = 0.5
}
```

You can also modify type of value to check from `Statement`s to `Line`s or `Branch`es:

```
checkScoverage {
    coverageType = 'Line'
    minimumRate = 0.5
}
```

```
checkScoverage {
    coverageType = 'Branch'
    minimumRate = 0.5
}
```
